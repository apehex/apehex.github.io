    title: Book Crunching
    description: >-
        They say a picture is worth a thousand words.<br/>The modern'&Agrave; la Recherche du temps perdu' is 1,267,069 words with would be 1267 pictures...<br/>Now that's a very dense serie, following several families over generations! It actually holds the record for the longest novel written.<br/><br/>So I'd bet we can capture the essence of many books with a single picture.
