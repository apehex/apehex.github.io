> The situation:
> - players are focused on the gain rather than the play
> - there's a lot of variance in the gains
> - the quality of play is seen on the long term
> - players often focus on the pocket cards
> - the context is broad: profile of the villains, perceived image, current state, stacks, position, stage of the game, pockets and board....
> - there's mental, technical, organisational and physical aspects
> - players don't exercise, they just play
> - players don't reflect back on their decisions and sessions

> The proposition:
> - a low profile tracking tool, with a lot of background processing 
> - interactive debriefing and analysis of the session
> - engage the player in a relfexion on his play and make him commit by setting objectives
> - give rewards and follow progression to keep the user psyched and aware of his evolution
