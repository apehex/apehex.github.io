> The situation:
> - the belt conveyors are critical machines for the production
> - the belt conveyors are overlooked as they don't participate in the creation of value
> - the belt conveyors are overlooked because they are part of the background
> - the belt conveyors have second order (indirect) costs, on the medium and long term
> - the industrial field relies on obsolete technologies

> The proposed tools:
> - give metrics on the impact of belt conveyors, to make their design and operation sensible tangible for the direction
> - streamlines the design, maintenance and audit processes around the belt conveyors
> - is flexible and adapts its propositions technical to your business objectives
> - are available on all platforms
> - don't require a technical background
