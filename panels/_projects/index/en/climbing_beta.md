> The situation:
> - (hooked) climbers usually progress very fast when they start
> - climbing is often practiced outside of a club, with no coach
> - the physical aspects are highlighted
> - climbing is very rich and demanding: it encompasses emotion management, focus, technic, a very fit body, and to respond to an unknown environment
> - after a year or so, most climbers plateau
> - the training routines are very dull, and scoped to the physical aspects

> The proposition:
> - analyse the user style in the background
> - engage a reflexion with the user and commit him to set his own objectives
> - add diversity by proposing challenges, exercises that are relevant and motivating
> - give rewards and follow progression to keep the user psyched and aware of his evolution
