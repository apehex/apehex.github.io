    description: >-
        I'm a vagabond tinkerer, living in the open. <br/><br/> I have a kink for tensors, I love functional programming and processing signals for hidden meaning. <br/><br/>I spend what's left of my time in remote places, they bring me back to the present to feel and think my way, literally.<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~*\o/~~~~~/\*~~~~~~~
