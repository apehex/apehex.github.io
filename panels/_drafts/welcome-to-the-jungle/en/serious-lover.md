and i thought my jokes were bad! so you want security and stability at the cost of:
- me flirting at school: other parents, teachers
- seduce your family
- you'll want to fuck my brains out when I'm gone, kill me when I'm there
- always take the side of your kid, play with him all the time and make fun of your authority
- i'll go deep in random, obscure hobbies
- dancing when you wanna chill, doing yoga when you wanna eat
- finish a dish
- be impredictable, inconstant and moody
- you'l be so bored of me you'll need to drunk yourself to death before fucking
- take a loan, marry you and cement this relationship before you have second thoughts 
- be totally ignorant of the world affairs/news but talk about futuristic/fantasy BS

I can have too much chocolate / wine!...
so however good I can be I'm pretty sure you're already puking
I'd say have a taste when ever you want, I can't be so far, I'm still an earthling.

being "serious":
- sacrificing one self for a "greater good"
- spliting bills, having spare money
- helping with chores
- having a "home", stable & securing
- getting into debt, we want strong bonds!
=> means being dishonest and not putting your whole self into your action, so the result can only be bad

"better bad sex than no sex"???? i soooo disagree
- i'm into sm, a little frustration can go a long way into building up desire and pleasure
- i use my time & energy for something else, more durable
- feel more control over my body / emotions

why sure, idk you but let's buy a house, move in
probably have sloppy, forced sex while fantasizing about others (keepin it real, still seriously screwing up)
may-be hate our guts, but still be serious, for the kids,
all of this keeping a stern, serious look anyway we're just a pile of dust
great, I love how you're thinking

live with a stranger because we wouldn't want sharing our insecurities, disagreements, fantasies, that's not serious!!

if you're

if you really love someone accept that

ohhhh i feel so mature right now, so serious!! may-be I should just go fuck myself??! :D

or I can keep being serious! we want to get to the bottom of this, and never, never again be serious.

so being serious is being sneaky and dishonest.

the act of marriage can be honest feelings , BUT staying married is pure BS

so I'd go for sincerity, there's more energy here and that's where we have a chance to feel each other

i can have too much wine and chocolate... and at this point you've had too much of me being serious !!

d-o-n-e, now let's play :D

no chance in hell I give in to my fear
