safety doesn't exist
you make it happen
stop complaining
you don't get upset because someone has "grillé la priorité"
it will happen, it's a matter of time

(should be glad that) you can overcome this !
it's not about wearing a cask or not, having a flashy suit on, respecting the code.
it's about being proactive, creating the space and attitude to maximize your odds.
the rest is 90% -useless- bs, stuff for weak willed idiots.

that's where roller & fixie come in : to me it was a commitment, a way to handicap myself in order to find new technics, have fun & adrenaline !
at first i just couldn't stop the fixie !.. i had to turn, find
and i liked the feeling, the rush and i kept imagining scenarios of people
felt so awake !
that's why i'm switching to rollers : i can't stop either ! the adrenaline is back yay :D

not about the legs
about positioning : space to the cars, walkers, 
about visibility
about assessing sources of danger
about anticipation : possible movements of the cars => position

anytime you have to visualize
how to react : turn, stop, use the car near you, there's no fall back ?
what can happen : 

rules
=> prioritize
