- manners vs country
- manners vs age
- tourism.......
  - tourism is less the act of exploring and discovering culture
  - than an opportunity to 
  - in particular act like assholes
- I understand the constant pressure to behave...
- obviously we need more ways to vent:
  - trashing places?
  - bashing places? like ripping
- actually may-be we can combine recycling and bashing?
- let people be assholes in peace
