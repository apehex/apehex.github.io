Don't you push your loved ones until they scream at you?
Don't you 

I've had so much experiences that feel off:
- run over without injuries
- falling from a cliff without injuries
- installing linux without spending days on drivers and whatnot

there's a ton of work and luck behind all this, it's just so unnatural!!

At some point, you're like "where's murphy??", "ok mfing matrix, i don't buy it"

I'm sure it's not working, there's a bug, I'm just not seeing it!..

Don't you try and look functional!

2 days later, boom
alright now we're talking! what took you so long??

I smell truth.

We should be so grateful that anything works!! I personally have 0 idea how/why electricity is delivered to my home, it's there!
I can't produce electricity myself, I can't transport it, if I think about it it's huge pain to make any of it reliable and secure on such a huge network... it's a fucking miracle!
So yeah

So all hail the infrastructure!! Here are a few graphics to show you the extent of the human
