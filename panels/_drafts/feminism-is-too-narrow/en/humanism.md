feminism is just one instance / manifestation of a human problem

1) making this a "Men vs Women" issue isn't helping:
    - you stigmatise people further:
        men are the abuser, who need to be checked
        women the abused, who need to be helped and protected
    - people are put on the defensive all the time
    - it's the same BS going on, women blablabla, men blebleble.... both sexes

2) this is about the abuse perpetrated by people in power:
    - I've seen women behave the exact same
    - this is a "human" problem

3) many other groups are the same position
    - all marginal groups are in the same position:
        - religious / metaphysical beliefs
        - political beliefs
        - upbringing / family / social models
        - race & physical appearance
        - cultural bodies
        - authority in organisations, society, families
    - what's marginal?
        - fewer in numbers
        - new / unknow to a culture
        - 

4) it's about:
    - difference in power: imposing 
    - empathy: not relating to the other side
    - ignorance: people feel think believe differently there's no right

frozen rules & behaviors should be replaced by intents:

Be:
- curious about others
- grateful
- etc etc

I'm an asexual, and one way or another women find me hot. This has led

this is all just so petty...
use your brain, stop pretending to be better that's really not the case.
humanity as a whole is worthless, you can fiddle all you want you're the same sacs of idiotic, dying, insignificant cells.
