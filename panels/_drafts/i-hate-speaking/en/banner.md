- how far back can I take a concept?
  - democracy?
  - AI?
  - family? the word is ugly in itself, there must be a typo because I feel disgusted typing it, a letter missing, an imbalance, something is very wrong here
- speaking/writing/communicating is slow
- speaking is incomplete
- speaking limits our ability to think 
- the conscience is a thing of the past:
  - it's the verbal formulation / summary of past experiences
  - it's not a new experience: words you use are past, memories are past, speaking is old, writing is old, typing is old
- words really are tools to manipulate:
  - babies
  - citizen
  - employees
- ever had new ideas??
  - new ideas come from new experiences... obvious...
  - human sensing has reach a platau... soooooooooooo what?
