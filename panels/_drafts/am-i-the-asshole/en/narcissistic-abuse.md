        I recognize a lot of the rational of Narcissistic in me and my family...
        This subreddit will definitely help me behave better. May-be I can give you a peak at the other side's intent/thinking/inside/rational/...
        Not as an excuse, not to make you feel sorry, just to shed light.

what:
- act cold / 
- devil's advocate
- project in the future
- view the situation from a complete

how:
- reflection/joke on myself (most people can't take this)
- second thought, to provide

why:
- to avoid self-pity
- to give alternative thinking and perspective
- to keep a distance in a professional setting:
  - don't discuss personal problems with clients
  - avoid giving emotional leverage (I so so hate when people try to manipulate with this cheap trick...)

most of the time it's because I ponder and analyse a situation, which is a way for me to 
i know blind support is way more 
but hell i'm different, i give a different perspective!!!

i feel there are 2 sides 
any idea/happening floating in-between is as important as you want it to be.

so yeah in a way you grow from anything, even narcissists.
i know i can feel pure hate about the judgements, non supportive attitude, them negating everything said & felt.
on the other hand I can think rationnally, view from , go through adverse environments.
not great, still useful.

now if ever I'm neglective
- i see myself as insignificant (doesn't put me down, that's fact, I don't go around bashing myself and others)
sometimes (especially in professional settings) I know I have overreacted... but I want to convey a clear message and stay on track with the mission / work at hand.

this doesn't mean I will ignore personal issues related to work.
just matters outside of it (family, etc)
