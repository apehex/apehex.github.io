The expedition
==============

- elephant head?
- union glacier?
- drake icefall?
- charle peak?
- fat bike / snowmobile
- internet? for focus
- realistic: not a holiday

What excites me in this expedition
==================================

2) most remote place: I can use the time & focus to fully learn about the science/tools/technology/challenges involved

1) also a wake up call for me: actually seeing how far plastic reaches, would make climate issues more palpable to me

7 + 6) experience on current earth the conditions and technology for the future / outer space
- SHIFT extend (change) my point of view, want to explore
- I can train for it

2) + 6) harsh environment to develop new skill and draw special 
shift / shake / wake my awareness

4 sociable) meet adventurous people! very excited to meet people with scientific understanding who have the nerve to come

8 practical) muck in / get my hands dirty
join field work with actual science

7) science: follow a project from the ground up (experiment, measures, data science, science)
sample, record, measure, analyse

6) Just looking at the map & images gives me thrills and a big smile!!

Written
-------

Just looking at the map, images from the BAS operations gives me genuine thrills and a big smile :D

I'm very excited to meet and help adventurous people, who have the nerve to organise & conduct studies in such a remote place!!

I can't fathom the amount of organisation, training, technology and work that goes into these expeditions. Seeing it first hand would be an incredible chance to me and a powerful drive to take a more active part.

My natural inclination is to systemize and organize things, I can't help thinking about it. As a programmer, I automate time consuming tasks and streamline workflows to empower people.

Obviously I'd be on the learning side again! But living and working with the team for a few days I'll get a glimpse of the internals and may-be a sense of how I could help too.

I'm very curious to see the operations and do as much as I can for the expedition. But I'm surprised about the short duration of the mission and the potential effort put into a random volunteer like me.
Hopefully it wouldn't be wasted and I'd get to participate from the ground sampling up to the analysis or communication?

I'm a mountain/outdoor enthusiast, so I'm really eager to experience novel conditions and terrain. The antartic ice looks incredible, I'd like to see and *keep* as much as possible!

And sensing plastic in these beautiful landscapes will surely be a wake up call... to further modify my daily life and convey these informations and most importantly practical measures 

I don't know how I can have missed this for so long, I should be there... plastic beat me to it!!!
I know I can be of help for this expedition and grow as a guide, a devops or a data scientist to support future endeavours.

Scrapes
-------

Field working in such extreme conditions must require a lot from us and the equipment, I'm
I'd welcome the isolation to fully focus on the work, science and people involved!

Hopefully, the expedition would be the chance to follow an experiment from the operations & ground sampling up to the analysis and communication.

As a programmer, I'm particularly interested in the data processing to trace the plastic in the ice back to our waste.
I'm also very curious about the modeling of the marine biochemistry and sea currents. I'd like to know more about the impact of plastic on marine life and how we infer it.

One way or another I need to work there! I know I can be of help in this expedition and grow as a guide or a data scientist for future endeavours.

I wouldn't have stepped without the help of an army

What I do for the env
=====================
(50 words)

List
----

- ride my bike + public transport everywhere: focused (can't take much) + organised + fit
- live minimally: buy the least, upcycle and repair: grow myself rather than my storage = skill and understanding (sewing, electronics)
- *clean up trash* I find on my path
- green computing: resource (power) conscious coding
- interested in what we can do about it: the practical measures everyone can/should take to lessen our imprint
- 
When going on tour (outdoor): I carry everything by bike / foot all the way around

Written
-------

I move almost exclusively on my bike, with public transport patches.
I follow a minimal lifestyle: I buy second hand, upcycle and repair as much as possible.
I clean up on my path, especially outdoors.
I'm not vocal about it, since I trade comfort and time, but I could be!
Especially as I see the need of social validation to make people move.

Scientific Skills
=================
(50 w)

List
----

2005-2012: General engineering and science education
2010: as an assitant researcher, I applied AI NN to map the decision making from brain activity MRI
correlate the brain activity in MRI scans with the decision process
2011: debugged and audited optimisation algorithms to mix fuels
2012-now: continuous programming for industrial ends
2019: signal processing, mitigate reverberation & noise in bla
I am myself a tool, a sort of interface between science and computers

Written
-------
I have a general engineering and science education.
I applied machine learning techniques to map decision making to the brain activity, optimize fuel mixes and automate the design of industrial processes.
