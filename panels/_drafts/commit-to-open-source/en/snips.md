And here I am coming to check on Snips!!

I never thought Snips was honestly pushing privacy by design for the sake of it.

It was obviously a business move and a company manipulating the open source community to its very own advantage.
Keeping closed sources, hyping the makers community, trading air "tokens" for true work, being very ambitious and pushing the business model and plans way before functionality were such very clear signs.
Worthless, backstabing, money as only real design kinda french BS.

Still, I can't keep a straight cynical "yeah I told you so kinda" face/mindset...
Seeing the effort from the community, I'm still very very disgusted and ashamed to see those gears cranking.....

It shows that I, a french developer, wen to Mycroft instead.

Buuut this is also giving new ideas and motivation.
It's great to see this petition and get the word out there. But we're diy people, begging now doesn't feel right either. 

Hahahaha look at me being so verbal while I didn't commit a single word!!!
What I would do to Snips/Sonos if my real work was bashed like this hahahaha
