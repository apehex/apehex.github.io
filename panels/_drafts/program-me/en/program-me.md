I'd like to be programmed!
==========================

Pitch
-----

lately I want to break free of my boring, routine life...
It occured to me I'm programming computers to behave as I (actually other) want.
So I should let people reprogram me!!

make myself a tool:
- style (cloths, shoes, nothing permanent)
-

Game Mechanics
--------------

Rules
-----

interactive story:
- graph of events
- characters
- plot

interactions = UI
- name of the activity??? != streaming
- twitch??
- youtube?
- slack
- my feed:
  - discreet = intra ear + read the live stream
  - how to follow the stream??
    - stop and go? decision points like a point and click game?
    - only read out the paid for actions

money:
- special account with subscription money
- 

what are my constraints / freedoms???
- can I comment / explain my actions to other people?
- can I decide when to act?
- 

can discuss the objectives

but you can only impose practical actions:
- do x
- say y
- with contextual information: if bla do x
