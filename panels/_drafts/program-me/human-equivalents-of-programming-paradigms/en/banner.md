imagine you want a new haircut

- assembly:
  - actually force the movement
  - physical level
  - everything is bad... do it once then forget about it!
- imperative:
  - give precise orders
  - describe the method
  - succession of instruction
  - adjusted in detail, at each instant
  - permanent presence of the controller
  - down:
    - hard to reproduce -1
    - needs expert -1
    - too rigid to fit another situation -1
    - no wiggle room for creativity
  - up:
    - clear?
- functional:
  - after a sequence of instruction has been integrated
  - ask to repeat a whole task
  - parametrized at the task level
  - up:
    - easier to reason / modify
    - flexible
- object:
  - focused on the tools
  - take the  
- declarative:
  - describes the result
  - rather than the process
  - whatever the means used, you trust it to find a way 
- "ai":
  - match situations with expected results
  - no description, you trust it to identify the significant features and the means to produce them
  - too vague -1
  - can be incoherent (I like x and y) -1
  - can be ambiguous (I want my hair done like a chameleon - yeah sure whatever you say boss) -1
  - requires close to no expert knowledge +1
- ie:
  - it's just a layer
  - we need a new language to describe the context / result
