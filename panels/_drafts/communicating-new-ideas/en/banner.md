- languages accelerate expression?
  - words and ideas: 
  - equality: how did the concept spread from quantity (measurements, units) to human rights?
- languages limit expression?
  - "AI": ooooold concept, we are fooling ourselves
  - children: force our view on them...
- similar problems:
  - lgbt and sexual orientation: choice vs innate
  - political ideas
  - economics: capitalism, communism, etc
  - concepts: property
- tech companies limit our ability to think:
  - languages vary from one company to another
  - they mirror the "how" rather than the "what"
  - to achieve the same result, we have to know how to express it 
  - native language vs foreign:
    - foreign languages don't allow expression of new ideas
    - they allow to communicate with people from a different culture
- everything you can say is old, known
  - voice in your head
- what's my aim?
  - center the languages on the what?
    - how languages are subordinates and mostly irrelevant
    - do it for "AI"
    - do it for "cyber-security"
- same ideas different application:
  - sewing and software: patching
  - software architect
  - cybersecurity
  - cyberspace
- core concepts?????
- practical conclusions:
  - all jobs are the same
  - hierarchy is artificial
  - everyone can do anything
  - it's a matter of taste
  - adults are absolute __M-O-R-O-N-S__
  - random, unconstrained behavior is __most valuable__
- humour
- metaphors?
- what about aging??
