### Rational

You actually build yourself (muscle and brain) when you rest!
Don't rush uselessly and recognize your current limit, while feeding your appetite for improvement.

### Tracking and Debriefing

### Metrics

### Self-Assessment

- I plan my training far in advance to prepare for a specific climb, trip,
  or expedition; or as a way to keep things progressive and avoid overtraining
- I study a route extensively to develop strategies for a successful ascent,
  imagining possible sequences, gear placement, and rest positions as well as
  developing what-if scenarios to aid risk management
