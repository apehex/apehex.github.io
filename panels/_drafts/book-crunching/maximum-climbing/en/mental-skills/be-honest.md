### Rational

Don't let others distract you:
- fear
- shame
- undermining
There's no reason to put down your inner personna.

### Tracking and Debriefing

### Metrics

### Self-Assessment

- throughout the day I'm aware of my decision-making processes, the direction
  and quality of my thought, and the outside triggers that affect my thoughts
- I monitor how I feel and assess the quality of my thoughts and actions
- I ponder my true motives for the things I do, big and small
- in making major decisions, I consider and leverage my hierarchy of personal
  values
- personal values

- I march to my own drummer and possess the confidence to step
  away from the crowd
- I get down on myself and question my ability and worth when
  I struggle on a climb or have an off day

### Objectives and Achievements

### Exercises and Habits

- meditation and observing your thoughts
