### Rational

You actually build yourself (muscle and brain) when you rest!
Don't rush uselessly and recognize your current limit, while feeding your appetite for improvement.

### Tracking and Debriefing

### Metrics

### Self-Assessment

- I give my all, so I can stop without remorse

### Objectives and Achievements

### Exercises and Habits
