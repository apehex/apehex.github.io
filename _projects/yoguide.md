> The situation:
> - the yogis focus on the asanas and the end result
> - the positions are very hard to nail: complex combinations of simultaneous stretch, contraction, alignment and decontraction

> The proposition:
> - analyse the user style in the background
> - engage a reflexion with the user and commit him to set his own objectives
> - add diversity by proposing challenges, exercises that are relevant and motivating
> - give rewards and follow progression to keep the user psyched and aware of his evolution
